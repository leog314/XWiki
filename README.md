**General:**

XWiki is a portable knowledge source for the TI-nspire calculator series written in Lua.

**Input and Controlls:**

To search something use the keypad for typing in the article name. After that press "enter" or use the handheld's cursor to select an article.
You will be redirected to the article, if it's available, otherwise the most promissing page will open.

By pressing the "return" key you get redirected to a randomly chosen article.

Any page consists of a text editor, where you can read the content of the article. Usually the content is a five sentence summary of the Wikipedia article.
Switch back to the homescreen by pressing "esc".

You can change the background color (=switch to dark/light mode) using "tab".
Characters (in the search bar) can be deleted using "del" (deletes last char) or "clear" (clears the search bar).

Note: I am aware that not everything might work as expected, work is still in progress. I hope that the app reacts fine anyway. :)

The project is open source, you can load your own articles and modify the GUI, if you want to. Please just mention this project, if you do so.

Anyway, I am not in any means responsible for the contents of this wiki nor of it's modifications. While discusting content should have been filtered out to some degree, this isn't guaranteed. You use the app at your own risk!

This project used 'Better Lua Api' by adriweb + contributors and Luna by Vogtinator + contributors.
